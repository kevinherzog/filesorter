# filesorter

simple filesorter, used for university stuff.
In theory it currently is highly customizable, the "my_classes.py" file can be used for anything e.g. "Screenshots", "torrent", etc.
It sometimes throws an error that currently is handled with the "trust me Bro" print out. This error is only thrown when the first case is met and the file was already moved.

_TODO_ :
- [ ] Refactor for windows
- [X] Use proper directories
- [ ] In future use a PI Zero W so it sorts to Google Drive
- [ ] Fix trust me bro
